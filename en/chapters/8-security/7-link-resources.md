# 🔐 Security

## Additional links and resources to read

The git [Awesome Node.js security repo](https://github.com/lirantal/awesome-nodejs-security) is a nugget not to be missed (it references a lot of projects, articles and other documents to help you wake up to security in Node.js).

Other resources (articles, talks, studies):
