# üîê Security

## Additional links and resources to read

The git [Awesome Node.js security repo](https://github.com/lirantal/awesome-nodejs-security) is a nugget not to be missed (it references a lot of projects, articles and other documents to help you wake up to security in Node.js).

I also recommend [Node.js Security Handbook](https://www.sqreen.com/resources/nodejs-security-handbook) by the Sqreen company to learn how to better secure your Node.js applications.

## Useful for OSS maintainers

Initiatives to learn about and implement

- [OpenSSF Security Scorecards](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard)
- [OSV - A distributed vulnerability database for Open Source](https://osv.dev/)
- [SLSA - Safeguarding artifact integrity across any software supply chain](https://slsa.dev/)

If you work on Github, I also recommend my latest article: [Securizing your GitHub org](https://dev.to/nodesecure/securize-your-github-org-4lb7)
