# 🔐 Security

## Additional links and resources to read

The git [Awesome Node.js security repo](https://github.com/lirantal/awesome-nodejs-security) is a nugget not to be missed (it references a lot of projects, articles and other documents to help you wake up to security in Node.js).

I also recommend [Node.js Security Handbook](https://www.sqreen.com/resources/nodejs-security-handbook) by the Sqreen company to learn how to better secure your Node.js applications.

## Useful for OSS maintainers

Initiatives to learn about and implement
