## If security is an area that interests you

If some of you want to discover and take an interest in the world of security on your own, I strongly recommend the following links:

- [Awesome security](https://github.com/sbilly/awesome-security)
- [Rootme (Une plateforme rapide, accessible et réaliste pour tester vos compétences en hacking)](https://www.root-me.org/)
- Participation in events like [Insomni'Hack](https://www.insomnihack.ch/) (PS: several members of the JavaScript community often participate).
