## Static Analysis & AST

As part of my [NodeSecure](https://github.com/NodeSecure/cli) project, one of my objectives was to succeed in detecting various and varied ‚Äúmalicious‚Äù codes that have been listed through various attacks.

When we talk about static analysis, it is therefore a question of analyzing a source code without ever executing it (otherwise it is rather a dynamic analysis). For this we will transform the code into AST format which will make the analysis of the code much simpler.

I recently gave a [talk in French](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSYrEbggqWA&feature=youtu.be) on the manipulation of AST in JavaScript which I recommend you watch. It is with these techniques that I managed to create my [JS-X-Ray](https://github.com/fraxken/js-x-ray) project (which is a SAST -> Static Application Security Testing tool).
