### Udemy vs Frontend Masters

Many developers make the mistake of choosing [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) as their learning platform for **JavaScript and Node.js**. The platform has a very unreliable business model and already [several scandals](https://www.troyhunt.com/the-piracy-paradox-at-udemy/) have broken out through time 😔.

It's important to understand, that when your goal is to succeed in finding a job in the next few months, it's rather problematic to rely on content with highly variable quality, little or not updated for years and sometimes even unethical 😮 (which doesn't mean there isn't good content either).

A rather blatant example of bad training is very often beliefs like "An async function/promise generates a thread in the background 💩 " (a sentence I myself heard in a course from a reputedly "**experienced**" trainer). Many are used to diminish the impact of these false beliefs.. Yet they have [real impacts in production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV-u_Ow47s0).

Instead, I recommend investing in a [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) account that will give you access to a set of up-to-date courses [with experts who are recognized and qualified](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/) in their respective fields (this is all the more necessary if you are aiming for both front and backend).

Some of their courses on Javascript (I invite you to look for yourself at the catalog of the many other courses available) :
