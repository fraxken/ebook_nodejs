# JavaScript

## 🌞 Introduction

To become a back-end developer is above all to understand that **you will spend your days writing codes in JavaScript** 😵 (a front-end developer will often in comparison have many other tasks like implementing mockups which will allow him to breathe).

Every day I meet developers who spend their time struggling because they never make the effort to overcome their **lack of understanding** on features that make up JavaScript or Node.js 😐 (Promise, Symbol, Reflection, Generators, Streams, Event-loop ...).

It is therefore necessary to train and educate yourself much more intensively than your colleagues who aspire to become "**mostly**" front-end developers (even if the front-end is also becoming more and more technical with sometimes frameworks that require an important mastery of JavaScript).

Interviews are **mostly based on your language skills** (the more fluent you are, the more likely you are to get the job). Whether it is for an algorithm, a challenge or even the creation of a project (an http API for example). 

If you spend ten minutes remembering how to set a key in an object, **then you've most likely blown your interview** 😭. Having experience with a framework or library is good, but it shouldn't come at the cost of a lack of JavaScript skills.
