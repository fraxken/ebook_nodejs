# JavaScript

## 💪 Challenge yourself regularly

Training through different exercises and challenges is important because it will allow you to improve many areas of your skill set:

- Algorithms (**don't expect incredible progression either** 😟).
- Improve your execution speed (fluidity to write the code).
- Practice (and **potentially** discover) language features. Note that in this case it is important to synchronize the discovery with a desire to document yourself (articles, talks, ebook).
- Allow you to discover a significant part of our daily life and the difficulties we have to face.

> I recommend that you regularly give yourself more or less intensive code sessions. It often happens to me to see beginners looking for a job taking "their time" only to complain after a few months that they are not making any progress 😑.

The following links will allow you to do a set of workshops and challenges:

- **[Beginner]** [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
-|FR **[Beginner]** [nodeschool](https://nodeschool.io/)
- **[Beginner]** [JavaScript Algorithms Crash Course - Learn Algorithms & "Big O" from the Ground Up!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgWm6sQwS_I) - Learning fundamentals of algorithms.
- **[Intermediate]** [jskatas](https://jskatas.org/) 
- **[Intermediate]** [warriorjs](https://warriorjs.com/) - Code your path through dungeons.
- **[Intermediate]** [“Build Your Own Array in Javascript!”](https://github.com/waterlink/Challenge-Build-Your-Own-Array-In-Js)

### 🏫 Nodeschool

If you're a beginner or new to the [Nodeschool](https://nodeschool.io/) workshops, I'll walk you through the different choices available to you. 

Note that you're going to need to get comfortable with command line instructions 😬 (**this is a good opportunity to get started if you haven't yet**).

> ⚠️ Some workshops are no longer maintained

Among the workshops I recommend (more or less in order):
- **[Simple]** [JavaScripting](https://www.github.com/sethvincent/javascripting)
- ~~[Learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode)~~
- **[Discovery]** [How to npm](https://github.com/workshopper/how-to-npm)
- [Functional JavaScript](https://github.com/timoxley/functional-javascript-workshop)
- **[Discovery]** [Planet proto](https://github.com/sporto/planetproto)
- **[Simple]** [Count to 6](https://github.com/domenic/count-to-6)
- **[Important]** [Promise it won't hurt](https://github.com/stevekane/promise-it-wont-hurt)
- [Learn generators](https://github.com/isRuslan/learn-generators)
- [Bytewiser](https://github.com/maxogden/bytewiser)
- **[Hard]** ~~[Stream Adventure](https://www.github.com/substack/stream-adventure)~~

### Bradley challenges

Beware these challenges are very difficult (and also require Node.js and V8 knowledge).

### 🔎 The other websites

Various websites offering various challenges and exercises:

- [CodingGame](https://www.codingame.com/)
- [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/)
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) (There are categories for Mathematics and Algo).

I don't necessarily have a recommendation for these (as far as I'm concerned, I don't necessarily like these sites).

### 🏆 Competitive programming

If some of you are highly motivated and want to get into code competitions (or math and algorithm solving is your thing ^^) well I recommend the following links:

- [What is Competitive Programming?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueNT-w7Oluw)
- [Competitive Programmer’s Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf)
- [Starting Competitive Programming - Steps and Mistakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVKHRtafgPc)
- [How to start Competitive Programming? For beginners!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAeiXy8-9Y8)
- [Fundamentals of algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/)
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)

This is a field that will require you to work very seriously on mathematics and to study the various existing structures and algorithms at length.

> 👀 Please note that my own goal is to climb the Codeforces ranking and to participate in several rounds in the coming years.
