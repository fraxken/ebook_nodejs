# 👋 Introduction

## 👀 Who am I?

My name is Thomas. I'm 26 years old and I've been independent (freelance) since the beginning of my career in 2015. Personally I've been developing since I was 10 years old (mainly around the web ecosystem 🌍).

I have been actively developing in Node.js since 2013 and consider myself as an Expert (I have to my credit several hundred projects in Node.js of which a major part is accessible and visible on my github).

I have worked on a lot of projects of various natures: APIs, CLI, native addon, npm packages, compiler etc.. I'm more and more interested in low level projects (C++ and Rust) related to the software world. I'm also more and more in love with the study of semantics and grammar of programming languages (a bit scientific / philosophical field 😵 ).

Beyond that I am also active in various projects, communities and groups:

- Founder and Mentor of [ES-Community](https://github.com/ES-Community) 💪🚀 (French-speaking JavaScript and Node.js community on Discord [depuis 2015](https://dev.to/fraxken/communaute-javascript-es-community-4nm3)).
- Lead maintainer of a large open-source project: [SlimIO](https://github.com/SlimIO) 😍. (A monitoring solution in Node.js and C++).
- Node.js contributor 🐢 (Member of the [Security Working Group](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg) 🔓). I work in on open-source projects related to security on Node.js: [Node-secure](https://github.com/ES-Community/nsecure), [JS-X-Ray](https://github.com/NodeSecure/js-x-ray)

## 👊 For whom?

This document is mainly aimed at developers (beginners or not 🐣) who want to move towards a **Node.js back-end** career. Potentially to people wishing to establish a cross-functional career with the motivation to undergo a rise in skills both back and front.

> 👀 As far as I'm concerned, I already had a significant experience in front-end when I started in 2013. So I can't blame you if you want to have both skills to your bow (but beware it's far from simple).


The document is not necessarily intended to be a vulgarization of existing resources that already do that very well (unless I think I have the opportunity and the skills to do it better). I prefer to see it as a **portal to a much better set of references**.

## 💬 Why?

It is always a pleasure for me to help others and share my knowledge and references ❤️. I already do this on a daily basis through the various communities and groups I am active in.

It is also an opportunity for me to work on building a document that brings together much of what has made up my journey 📚 (**and potentially challenge myself and do some new research**). This should make it much easier for me personally to train juniors and mentees by helping them with my own document 💡.

## 📌 Legends

The document includes a set of references (links) to videos and articles that are segmented by level of difficulty and language (FR French or EN English). 

**[Beginner]**
These are often popularization or information resources accessible to beginners. Be careful on certain tough subjects, the notion of a beginner can nevertheless imply that you have acquired skills.

**[Intermediate]**
These are resources that require a certain foundation to be able to approach them. However, this does not mean that they will technically require a long time to be addressed.

**[Advanced]**
Unlike intermediate, advanced resources are much more technically and practically hairy.

**[To know]**
These are links dealing with subjects that are interesting to know (often details on the functioning and behaviors that are not well understood, etc.). These are often beginner/intermediate resources.

The ratings are not perfect and they are here mainly to try to guide you as much as possible.
