# GIT

GIT is undoubtedly one of the most essential tools for a developer (whether in Node.js or others). If you don't know what GIT is, here is the Wikipedia page.

If you are a complete newbie 🐤 then I recommend git-it which is a pretty damn good guide with an electron app. Get into the habit of saving your work on github very quickly so that you can practice as much as possible with the basic commands (I also recommend that you follow the following convention for writing your commit messages).

There are a few books that will go through a whole set of notions vis-à-vis GIT... I'll be honest I didn't learn everything myself but reading these ebooks was very beneficial for me to improve :

- [Pro GIT](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
- [Mastering GIT (paying)](https://www.raywenderlich.com/4289-mastering-git)
- [Git Immersion](https://gitimmersion.com/)

We are lucky in France to have quality articles, talks and training thanks to Delicious insights (Christophe Porteneuve and his colleagues). Much of the content below is free, but if you can afford it, I highly recommend investing in a course:

- [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)

> 👀 Although it is possible to use graphical interfaces, I recommend that you get into the habit of doing it on the command line so as not to constrain / limit yourself in the future.
