# TypeScript

## üê≤ Ressources on types

I now realize that it is difficult for me to offer you a maximum of resources on the subject, as I have lived and worked with the different versions of TypeScript as they have been released (since version 1.1).

So I always had a more or less linear learning process üòä.

However, I think it's impossible to become a TypeScript Expert if you don't have the basics in JavaScript (of course you do... for example if you don't understand what a Primitive or an Object is how do you expect to annotate correctly?)
