# TypeScript

## Introduction

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript (i.e. JavaScript but with type annotations). The compiler also offers features that allow a stricter source-to-source compilation.

In the Javascript ecosystem, TypeScript is becoming more and more popular and is used in many situations even in classic JavaScript (through [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) or definition file). 
If you are using VSCode to write JavaScript then TypeScript is also doing you a favor without realizing it :) 

You can see [here](https://octoverse.github.com/) that JavaScript is the most popular language while TypeScript is fourth.

There are a good number of debates on the Internet about the advantages and disadvantages of TypeScript. Like everything in life, nothing is black and white and you have to keep your feet on the ground. As far as I'm concerned, I like to juggle between projects in JavaScript and projects in TypeScript (depending on the context and the project).

I think it is important to say that here we are talking about strict TypeScript (I have done many missions on codes with types **any** everywhere...).

It is true that when a code is properly annotated with interfaces and types, it is often easier to maintain the code (and certainly easier to read and understand for developers with less experience). Finally, this is obviously a feeling that is certainly not concrete (you also have to trust your colleagues... nothing says that they have annotated the code correctly ^^).
