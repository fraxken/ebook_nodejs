## TC39

At some level, it will be interesting for you to take a closer look at the work done by [TC39](https://tc39.es/) which is the group responsible for the specification of the language üíñ. To better understand what TC39 is as well as the role of the different members composing this group I invite you to listen to the [following talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slA06pbTRi4&list=PL37ZVnwpeshHwJPVBqEnZild7QHWhdufu&index=13) (or the one from the [previous year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj5q8uyqGYc&list=PL37ZVnwpeshG2YXJkun_lyNTtM-Qb3MKa&index=9)).

It is for example possible to follow the next features that will arrive in JavaScript thanks to the following [git repo](https://github.com/tc39/proposals). The entirety of the proposals follows a well-defined process that is described [here](https://tc39.es/process-document/).

If you want to learn how to read and understand the [ECMAScript specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/), I invite you to read [the following articles](https://v8.dev/blog/tags/understanding-ecmascript) from the V8 team.
