## JavaScript or ECMAScript ?

JavaScript was invented in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an employee of the company Netscape Communications. Microsoft follows him by including JavaScript in its Internet Explorer software, then in version 3. For reasons of trademark rights, it is called JScript.

The specification was then validated by the Ecma International organization in June 1997 under the name ECMAScript, standard ECMA-262.

The term JavaScript has remained in the common vocabulary, but in fact it is ECMAScript.
