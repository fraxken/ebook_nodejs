## Modules (CJS & ESM)

In Node.js there are two ways to manage modules:

- [CJS](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html) for Common JavaScript
- [ESM](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html) for ECMAScript modules

ESM is the new standard integrated since ECMAScript 6 for module management. However, historically Node.js has been using CJS since the beginning and at the time there were a lot of concerns about the ESM specification (which made the implementation in the Node js ecosystem complex).

```js
const { foo } = require("mymodule");

exports.foo = function boo() {
    return foo();
}
```

With CJS it is necessary to use the require() function and keywords like module.exports while in ESM you can use the import and export keywords.

```js
import { foo } from "mymodule";

export function boo() {
    return foo();
}
```

ESM support on Node.js is becoming more and more stable and it is therefore not surprising that it will become the default module system in the near future.
