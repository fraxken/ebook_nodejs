# 🐢 Node.js 

## 🐥 Resources for beginners

Since a couple of years there has been the nodejs.dev website which offers an excellent way to start the adventure with Node.js. 

Among the other resources I recommend :

- **[Intermediate]** [Official Node.js guides](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/)
- **[Beginner]** Liz Parody's article: [ABC’s of JavaScript and Node.js](https://nodesource.com/blog/ABC-of-JavaScript-and-Nodejs) to learn and understand the different keywords used in the Node ecosystem.
- **[Beginner]** [Art of Node](https://github.com/maxogden/art-of-node) by Maxogden (not bad for those with programming experience).
- **[Intermediate]** If you are looking for a more advanced reading I recommend: [Node.js design patterns](https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/).
- **[To know]**  [Best practices](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices) for Node.js projects.
- **[Beginner]** [Free Introduction to Node.js (OpenJS)](https://openjsf.org/blog/2021/02/18/free-node-js-online-training-now-available/)
- **[Beginner]** [Learn Node.js with Microsoft](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbl2SbVIi-Wo0EkNoLEnx4BE_xm4SsSRj)

We had discussed about [NodeSchool](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JHgmEFkc8Py4XSuCB8_DQ5FFEJoogyeninFK6ucTd4o/edit#heading=h.70tu7zxaybuj) in the JavaScript section (it's a great way in addition to other links to start and train on Node.js).
