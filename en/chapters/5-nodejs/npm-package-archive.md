# 🐢 Node.js

## 📦 npm package archive

I myself, several months ago, created an [awesome-list of Node.js packages](https://github.com/fraxken/awesome-crafted-nodejs) that I highly recommend. These are packages that meet specific needs, often with fewer (or none at all) dependencies or with much more optimal performance.

My list also includes people to follow on github (they all publish very interesting packages more or less often). Feel free to PR to add packages that fit into the repo description.

There is also the awesome-list of Sindresorhus accessible [here](https://github.com/feross/awesome-mad-science).
