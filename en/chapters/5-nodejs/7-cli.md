## 📟 CLI

The Node.js and JavaScript ecosystem is very vast and therefore very interesting for building [CLI](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/command-line-interface) (command line interface) tools.

These tools are very commonly used and developed to simplify the life of developers and integrators in various projects. Many frameworks and libraries have their own CLI to offer developers an optimal experience. We use them every day (sometimes without even realizing it).

I often recommend to the beginner to discover Node.js by building a CLI (for example a small RPG game in text format playable with commands... it's really an idea of a small project that pushes you to improve your level of mastery in JavaScript).

If you want to get started, I recommend [this little guide](https://x-team.com/blog/a-guide-to-creating-a-nodejs-command/) or also Create a command line tool (french) which will teach you how to set up a simple CLI. Also I recommend you to read the [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-link) doc as well as the doc on the [bin field](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-json#bin) of the package.json.

Some packages I recommend:

- [kleur](https://github.com/lukeed/kleur) (for color text in the terminal, there is also [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk)).
- [inquirer.js](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js) (there is also [enquirer](https://github.com/enquirer/enquirer)).
- [cliui](https://github.com/yargs/cliui)
- [sade](https://github.com/lukeed/sade)
- [boxen](https://github.com/sindresorhus/boxen)
- [Elegant terminal spinner](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ora)
- [gauge](https://github.com/npm/gauge)
- [@topcli/prompts](https://github.com/TopCli/prompts)

If you ever want to see a concrete case I invite you to look at the CLI of one of my projects [Node-secure](https://github.com/ES-Community/nsecure) or [npq](https://github.com/lirantal/npq) of Liran tal.
