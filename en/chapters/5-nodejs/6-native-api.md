# üê¢ Node.js

## üëΩ Native API (native addon creation in C and C++)

With Node.js it is also possible to create [low level interfaces (addons)](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html) to for example execute libraries written in C, C++.

This can bring a performance advantage (but this is not necessarily always the goal... going from C++ to JavaScript has a significant cost). Sometimes it is also simply because the C/C++ libraries are already very complete and maintained (it would be potentially a waste of time to re-implement everything in JavaScript).

Some examples of NPM packages being native addons :

- [node-argon2](https://github.com/ranisalt/node-argon2)
- [node-sqlite3](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3)
- [Windrive (Done by myself to get informations on the system)](https://github.com/SlimIO/Windrive)

Moreover, to install these packages, you often need to install various dependencies to be able to compile them. I invite you to consult the [installation section](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) of Node-gyp if you were not aware of this. (There is also an option to install Node.js on Windows).

If this is a topic that interests you, [I myself did a talk in 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvmnnlYf3lk) to popularize and explain my first steps in creating native addons for my SlimIO project. 

However, here is a complementary list of resources:

- [Node-addon-api](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api) (For those who want to write code in C++).
- [Node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) (This is the tool that you will use to compile your addon).
