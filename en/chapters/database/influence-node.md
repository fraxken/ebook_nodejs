# 💾 Database

## Influence of Node.js on the chapter

This chapter will be strongly influenced by the fact that we are in Node.js and my goal is not to cover all the database solutions in the world, but simply to guide you to the essentials.

It is important to understand that some databases do not have any official connector in Node.js and this therefore implies that it is left to the community to maintain low-level bindings which often require very high technical skills. .

The databases that will be cited in the following chapters are for me those that have the most support as well as the qualities necessary to be used in sustainable professional contexts.

This does not imply at any time that it is not possible to use another base (let's be clear).
