# 💖 Thanks

It's time for goodbyes and tears of sadness 😭 (or joy? 😈). I would like to thank all the people without whom this document would not have been possible (or at least not with the same level of quality).

A big thank you to the members of the [French-speaking JavaScript and Node.js community](https://github.com/ES-Community/Code-of-conduct) without whom I would never have been able to acquire so much knowledge and references. Even though, I am the founder of Discord, I can only be honored by your daily participation and this now for more than five years for some of you.

Thanks to those who advised and helped me in writing and correcting the document;

- [Tony Gorez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonygorez/) (his [tonygo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0yiy-XPDRVAgLaAiA8kvrQ) youtube channel).
- [Alexandre Malaj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandre-malaj-6062b0a6/) (my partner and colleague).
- [Nadia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadiamedkouri/)
- Koko (ES-Community mentor)
