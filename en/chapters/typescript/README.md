# TypeScript

## üôä TypeScript is secondary
More and more novice developers are being pushed into TypeScript without really understanding what it is (which confuses them even more in their journey).

Today it is not uncommon to come across developers who think that TypeScript is completely unconnected to JavaScript. Which is completely false (it is even quite the opposite).

It is important to learn things in the right order... (which doesn't mean that you can't train in parallel to better understand the different type annotations available in TypeScript and challenge yourself on how to write it).

Take the time to build a foundation in JavaScript to better understand the advantages and disadvantages when choosing TypeScript for your projects.

## üê≤ Ressources sur l‚Äô√©criture d‚Äôannotation de types

I now realize that it is difficult for me to offer you a maximum of resources on the subject, as I have lived and worked with the different versions of TypeScript as they have been released (since version 1.1).

So I always had a more or less linear learning process üòä.

However, I think it's impossible to become a TypeScript Expert if you don't have the basics in JavaScript (of course you do... for example if you don't understand what a Primitive or an Object is how do you expect to annotate correctly?)
