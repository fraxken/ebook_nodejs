# TypeScript

## 🙊 TypeScript is secondary
More and more novice developers are being pushed into TypeScript without really understanding what it is (which confuses them even more in their journey).

Today it is not uncommon to come across developers who think that TypeScript is completely unconnected to JavaScript. Which is completely false (it is even quite the opposite).

It is important to learn things in the right order... (which doesn't mean that you can't train in parallel to better understand the different type annotations available in TypeScript and challenge yourself on how to write it).

Take the time to build a foundation in JavaScript to better understand the advantages and disadvantages when choosing TypeScript for your projects.

> ✨ I have nothing against TypeScript and I use it every day through various company and personal projects... even in projects purely written in JavaScript: TypeScript remains omnipresent (VS Code, Type Definition, JSDoc ...). 
>
>  My goal is to warn about the shortcuts that are often made and that will potentially harm the watch of the most beginners. ✨
