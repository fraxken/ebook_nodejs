# üíæ Database

## MongoDB

The famous database... the one that generates joy, tears and anger in the ecosystem. Let's be clear: **MongoDB is the most popular base in the ecosystem.**

There is nothing to say about the [native driver](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native) support‚Ä¶ which makes it for me one of the strongest databases in terms of support. The MongoDB company also has very talented Node.js developers like [Addaleax](https://github.com/addaleax), which nevertheless reinforces the feeling of support and quality with regard to the tools that the publisher offers to the ecosystem.

I made my debut in Node.js and, like many, I followed the dance when I discovered MongoDB. **It was an excellent experience for me** who had only done SQL and I must say that I always rather enjoyed doing Mongo (it opened me up to other horizons and ways of thinking).

Nevertheless, I myself took the time from the beginning to read the documentation carefully because I had understood that **I had to stop thinking in relational terms** (without really knowing what that really meant at the beginning). My mission at BNP Paribas on the construction of a PaaS allowed me to push my mastery in particular on the management of shard data (with all the constraints that you eat on the corner of your nose).

Besides, I never understood the madness behind [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) and the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding relationships on a base that is not relationship...

After a few years, I can now tell you that I understand very well why many developers and architects complain about choosing MongoDB for projects where a relational database would have largely done the job.

It is true that many start projects on MongoDB when a base like PostgreSQL would have been a much better choice at all levels. Many therefore build gasworks or they try to make Mongo a relational base üò®.

I don't think we should go to extremes. If you are a junior developer I recommend that you experiment as much as possible with different databases.
