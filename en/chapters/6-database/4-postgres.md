## PostgreSQL

In the Node.js ecosystem, Postgre has become a must for me in terms of an open-source SQL database.

We are lucky to have drivers actively maintained by the community like [pg-promise](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise) or [postgres](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postgres). I never had the opportunity to test yet but there is also:

- [slonik](https://github.com/gajus/slonik)
- 🆕 [massive.js](https://massivejs.org/).

The project itself is also very actively maintained and monitored. It really is an ideal choice for both personal and professional projects. Over the past two years, this is also reflected in the number of offers specifying PostgreSQL as the database (as far as I am concerned, it was the database in place on all of my last missions).

In short, I therefore strongly encourage you to take an interest in this database with the [following page](https://www.postgresql.org/about/) which presents the project and its advantages.
