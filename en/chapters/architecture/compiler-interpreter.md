# 🌇 Architecture & Paradigms

## Compiler & Interpreter

In addition to the V8 engine section, I think it is important to add a section that talks about concepts that also go a little further than what is available in JavaScript.

These are often notions that many consider to be extremely advanced but I think that above all it is necessary to have a certain interest in the subject (it is not necessarily death to be apprehended either).

First of all, I really recommend [Dmitry Soshnikov's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC15UOu9F157NAXGL9dHc4TQ). There is also his [website](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/) which is full of articles explaining various topics related to modern compilers (a real goldmine).

My github contains a [section dedicated](https://github.com/fraxken/VM-Resources#papers-and-academic-research) to various academic research on modern compiler optimizations.
