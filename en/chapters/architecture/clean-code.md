## Clean Code

The notion of clean code was introduced through [Robert Martin's book](https://www.amazon.fr/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882). Nevertheless most of the time clean code is often a set of conventions that are specific to each ecosystem (with foundations sometimes common to several languages).

For example, naming your variables correctly is **rather common sense** (personally, I was already doing ‚Äúclean code‚Äù before knowing the very notion of clean code).

However, you have to understand that you should not stupidly apply these rules without taking into account the context or even the opinion of your team. It is now not uncommon to see tools like SonarQube appear that will recommend following patterns for the sole purpose of giving you a "positive" rating.
