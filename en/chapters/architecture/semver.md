# 🌇 Architecture & Paradigms

## SemVer

SemVer is the standard that will allow us to manage and increment our versions of software, packages and tags in the Node.js ecosystem (in any case it is the most frequently mastered and used).

I will not popularize the subject because it is already done here. (a page that should have been read by any JavaScript/Node.js developer).

Other useful resources:
