# üî¨ Monitoring

## Introduction

As a developer, it is important to know how to identify the metrics and practices that will allow us to reflect and build monitoring for our applications (web or desktop). **We will mainly talk about APM here**.

Some modern frameworks like fastify already have [packages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fastify-metrics) to export metrics (promeheus format).

The most important metrics in Node.js are often those concerning the event-loop. I recommend the following resources to you which will go through different means of exploiting them;

- [NodeConf Remote 2020 - Trevor Norris - Introduction to Event Loop Utilization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WetXnEPraYM&list=PL0CdgOSSGlBalMPxFFycq7OIqQF8cJS28&index=13)
- [Introduction to Event Loop Usage in Node.js](https://nodesource.com/blog/event-loop-utilization-nodejs/)
