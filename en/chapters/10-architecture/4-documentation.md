## Documentation

For me, knowing how to build documentation **is one of the rarest and most valuable skills among developers**. This is also for me a critical point of non-hiring among junior candidates! Coming up with projects that have absolutely no documentation (markdown) is not acceptable in my opinion.

For a project on github for example:

- What are the prerequisites of the project? (version of Node.js, database used etc).
- What need does the project meet?
- Are diagrams available to better understand the architecture and the choices made in the project / code?

So remember to document your personal projects well because I think this has a very important impact for both technical and non-technical people (and I'm not talking about copying and pasting a getting started). Personally, I don't need to see the code of a developer who builds documentation rigorously...

Example projects to inspire you: [JS-X-Ray](https://github.com/fraxken/js-x-ray), [SlimIO Config](https://github.com/SlimIO/Config), [Flydrive](https://github.com/Slynova-Org/flydrive), [Hooks](https://github.com/poppinss/hooks).

Other resources, tools and packages to build documentations:

- [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) (see also [ESDoc](https://esdoc.org/). Personally I had made my [own fork](https://github.com/fraxken/minami) of minami).
- DocType
- Github Pages
- What it takes to build great product documentation
- Beyond the README: Creating Effective Documentation for Your Project by Rand McKinney, IBM

If you are building an API: having an [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) with for example a [Swagger](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) interface can be a big plus (a postman collection can also do the trick).
