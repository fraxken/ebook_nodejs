## Object Oriented Programming

As for me, I have been seriously studying the roots and semantics of OO languages ​​for two years and I feel like an alien 👽 when I hear others talk about the subject.

For starters, there's [no consensus on an exact definition of OO](https://wiki.c2.com/?NobodyAgreesOnWhatOoIs) (so take it with a grain of salt who sells exact definitions 😞). It is therefore very risky to take a stand because it will require you to have an understanding and arguments that 99.9% of developers do not have (including me at the moment).

Below are two links that are rather important to read to start getting a good idea of ​​the fundamental principles of OO:

- [The definitions of Alan Kays](https://wiki.c2.com/?AlanKaysDefinitionOfObjectOriented) (the one many consider to be the founding father of OO with Smalltalk).

There are many other definitions and speculations that you can find [here](https://wiki.c2.com/?DefinitionsForOo). For my part, I also read a good part of [Theory of objects](http://lucacardelli.name/TheoryOfObjects.html) which allowed me to open my eyes to a lot of notions at a semantic level.

Second, I really recommend that you dig into the notion of Data abstraction. It's such a foundation of what makes up programming languages ​​that I don't even understand how the majority of developers miss it.

Some resources to read / listen to:

- [How Data Abstraction changed Computing forever | Barbara Liskov | TEDxMIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTc1BTFdIo)
- [On Understanding Data Abstraction, Revisited](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~wcook/Drafts/2009/essay.pdf)
- [Object-Oriented Programming Versus Abstract Data Types](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~wcook/papers/OOPvsADT/CookOOPvsADT90.pdf)

I also recommend [Programming Paradigms for Dummies](https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/VanRoyChapter.pdf) which allows you to build a bridge with other notions (and not only OO because it is important to also open up to the rest).

### Complementary Ressources

If you have started reading it means that you have understood that I am not a fan of boat explanations in **"It's a cat that extends from an animal to meow"** 😏.

I've never been a big fan of these high-level articles because I always felt there was a lack of fundamental thought in the process. Abstracting the technical elements to communicate them better is an important thing, but I don't think we should stray too far from a more scientific reality either.

If you want to continue to really dig into object-oriented programming, here are various references that I have read myself (be careful, they are often difficult to access):

- [Object-Oriented Programming in Scheme](https://mumble.net/~jar/pubs/oopis.pdf)
- [A Self Bibliography](https://bibliography.selflanguage.org/)

> 👀 The references above may also help you understand some Javascript roots better. I was personally really shocked to discover that many of what are criticized as features that were randomly done in 10 days **are ultimately semantic notions thought over decades ago**.


- [Inheritance Is Not Subtyping](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~wcook/papers/InheritanceSubtyping90/CookPOPL90.pdf)
- [A Behavioral Notion of Subtyping](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wing/publications/LiskovWing94.pdf)
- [A Denotational Semantics of Inheritance](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~wcook/papers/thesis/cook89.pdf)
- [Representing Type Information in Dynamically Typed Languages](https://www.cs.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/TR93-27.pdf)
- [Concurrent Object-Oriented Programming in Act 1](https://web.media.mit.edu/~lieber/Lieberary/OOP/Act-1/Concurrent-OOP-in-Act-1.html)
- [The Power of Interoperability: Why Objects Are Inevitable](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/papers/objects-essay.pdf)
- [Law of demeter](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/demeter/papers/law-of-demeter/oopsla88-law-of-demeter.pdf)
- [Object Design - Rebecca Wirfs-Brock and Alan McKean](https://www.informit.com/promotions/object-design-142314?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=wrifsbrock&utm_campaign=objectdesign&utm_term=pdf)

From all this you will be able to find several hundred references. I have read other works but I do not think they have a place here (although I remain open to discussion if you wish to deepen this yourself with my recommendations).
