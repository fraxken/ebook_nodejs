## Design Pattern

Developers these days like to follow these famous “design patterns” to discover various ways to solve problems they encounter (alone or in a team). Many Node.js frameworks are also often built using a set of design patterns (Adapter, Factory, Singleton, Observer etc.).

Design patterns are often necessary to better specify, identify and discuss as a team various problems and how to solve them through abstractions that will be clearly identifiable by the whole team.

I use and build many of these patterns myself very regularly. Some links and resources to discover and document the different existing design patterns:
