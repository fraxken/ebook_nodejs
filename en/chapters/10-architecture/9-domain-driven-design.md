## DDD (Domain Driven Design)

Software is a means like any other to an end / to a real goal. Since software is not an end in itself, it must remain practical, useful and ergonomic.

Domain Driven Design refers to business-driven design. It is a business-centric approach to software development through (technical) design patterns, conceptual models.
