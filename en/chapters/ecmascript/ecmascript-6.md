## ECMAScript 6 (ES2015)

In 2015 the version 6 of ECMAScript was released which added a lot of features to the language. Today I would rather talk about modern JavaScript to refer to the learning and mastering of new features that are implemented every year (and not only ES6).

From 2015 it is common to use the year to designate the version of JavaScript... Instead of ECMAScript 8 we will use ES2017.
