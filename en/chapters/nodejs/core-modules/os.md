The core [OS](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html) module is made up of a set of utilities that will allow you to interact and retrieve information about your system. For example :

- The network interfaces on your machine.
- Information about your CPUs (load, endianness, model, speed).
- Information about your machine's memory.
- Information about your operating system (version, temporary directory, root directory, etc.).
